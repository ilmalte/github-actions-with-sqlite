# SIMPLE SQLITE SCRIPT SCHEDULED WITH GITHUB ACTIONS
This repo only wants to be a super simple test of sqlite and github actions!

## How to launch
In the package.json you can find a script to help you during the development process.
You only need to launch the following commands in your Linux terminal (WSL as well).
`
npm install     # if needed
npm run dev
`

# How to build
Right now the build process is considered a TODO. The aim is to automate everything: commit changes then deploy a build on Github Pages, Netlify or similar.
